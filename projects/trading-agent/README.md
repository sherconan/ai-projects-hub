# Trading Agent (Static)

This is a lightweight, static reproduction of the RockAlpha AI-Stock page:
- Header with logo and tagline
- Hero with key messaging and CTAs
- AI agent cards (avatars, names, quick copy buttons)
- Live AI-sector ticker (mocked updates)
- Live trades feed (mocked events)
- Leaderboard (mocked PnL that updates over time)

How to run:
- Open `index.html` in your browser (no build needed)

Notes:
- Images use hosted avatar URLs for realism. If offline, they will show placeholders.
- All data is mocked on the client; adjust in `app.js` as needed.
